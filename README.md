# Codeocean's capsule link of the app
**[EWU RAG Chatbot](https://codeocean.com/capsule/7111456/tree)** (Student ID access needed)

## Objective
This project implements the functionalities of using LLMs (Large Language Models) of ***GROQ API Interface*** to answer questions based on its own dataset.

# Tools and Libraries used
- **[Ollama]** : For creating embeddings using the open source embedding model **'nomic-embed-text'**
- **[RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter]** : For chunking the document into smaller segment
- **[ChromaDB]** : App's vector database for storing embeddings
- **[GROQ API]**  : Faster inference with the LLMs hosted inside GROQ's interface. 
- **[LangChain]** : Where most of the libraries are used from.
- **[Streamlit]** : App's framework or UI (User Interface)

# Requirements to run the app
- Clone the repository by typing in the terminal ```git clone https://github.com/ihkcreations/EWU_RAG_Chatbot.git```
- Install the necessary libraries first in a virtual python environment by typing ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 
- Then download Ollama from [here](https://ollama.com/download)
- After downloading Ollama, start Ollama server by typing: ```ollama serve``` in the terminal
- Pull the Embedding Model by typing ```ollama pull nomic-embed-text```
- Edit the **.env** file by placing your own GROQ API Key there. Get your GROQ API Key from [here](https://console.groq.com/keys). Make sure to create a GROQ account first.
- After downloading the model, start the **app.py** by typing in the terminal ```streamlit run app.py```

Enjoy asking questions related to our East West University.
